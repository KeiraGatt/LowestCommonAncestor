# LowestCommonAncestor

Let T be a binary search tree with nodes n1 & n2. The lowest common ancestor between two nodes n1 and n2 is defined as the lowest node in T that has both n1 and n2 as descendants.

The Java implementation was developed in Eclipse, an enviroment I am familiar with.
The unit testing for Java was done using JUnit Tests. Code coverage was analysed using EclEmma. As of 12.10.21 coverage is 100%.

The Python implementation was developed in PyCharm, a language & enviroment I am new to.
The unit testing framework used was unittest. Code coverage was analysed using Coverage.py. As of 12.10.21 coverage is 100%.

Current functionality of both Java & Python implementations:

1. Calculate LCA of 2 valid keys.
2. Insert key into tree.
3. Check if tree is empty.
4. Get size of tree.
5. Print inorder traversal of tree.
